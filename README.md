# mysql-selfmanaged

What cloud environment you decided to use?

How you set up your VM (what image you selected - imagine writing a brief tutorial to a new user - what would you include and how to quickly and easily set up a new VM) 

The commands you used to setup the OS image (how did you update the OS image? how did you install the mysql)

What changes you needed to make in order to make the mysql instance available to external computers (config file? opening ports?)
